# Subway Data Analysis for Street Teams

he objective for this project was to analyze MTA subway data to help deploy street teams to increase participation for a summer fundraiser to encourage more women in tech. My approach was to isolate the subway stations with the most traffic depending on whether it was a weekend or a workweek and which hours and days were best to have street teams in the stations.
